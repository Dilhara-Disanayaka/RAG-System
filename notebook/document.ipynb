We experimented with three algorithms—K-\\nmeans, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN—on RFM (Re-\\ncency, Frequency, Monetary) features as input data. Hierarchical\\nclustering with single linkage gave the best of the methods tried\\nwith a silhouette score of 0.945, while for K-means it was 0.581\\nand that for DBSCAN was 0.470. The research produced three\\nsets of customers with varying shopping behaviors. These are\\nfindings that can be used to guide the formulation of customer\\nrelationship and focused marketing strategies.\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nRetailers in recent times gather huge amounts of data from\\ncustomer purchases. This information provides insights into\\nhow consumers shop and prefer things. With segmentation of\\ncustomers exhibiting similar behavior, companies can develop\\nmore successful marketing campaigns.\\nWe use RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and\\nthree clustering methods to segment customers in this study.\\nWe then compare results to find out which method performs\\nbetter and analyze the business insights derived from the\\nsegments.\\nII. METHODOLOGY\\nA. Feature Engineering\\nWe used the Online Retail Dataset from UCI Repository.\\nThe dataset contains transactions for a UK-based online\\nretailer. The original dataset had 541,909 records with 8\\ncolumns.\\nwe used several data pre-processing techniques. First, re-\\nmoved records with missing CustomerID values. This reduced\\nthe dataset to 406,829 records—next filtered data rows for\\nUnited Kingdom customers only. All the cancelled orders were\\nfiltered and removed, leaving 354,345 records.\\nRFM features were calculated:\\n• Recency: Days since last purchase from the maximum\\ndate (2011-12-09)\\n• Frequency: Total number of distinct purchases per cus-\\ntomer\\n• Monetary: Total purchase value (Quantity × UnitPrice)\\nThe RFM analysis created 3,920 customer records. To\\nremove the outliers used the IQR method and the final dataset\\ncontained 3,538 customers. Features were standardized using\\nStandardScaler to ensure equal weighting.\\nThe RFM feature distributions are shown in Figure 2, which\\nreveals the characteristics of our customer data. The 3-D\\nscatter plot analysis in Figure 1 illustrates the relationships\\nbetween different RFM components. The correlation matrix\\nshows (Figure 3), there are negative correlations between\\nRecency and other features, while between Frequency and\\nMonetary has a positive correlation (0.509).\\nFig. 1. 3D Scatter plot of RFM'),\n",

Clustering Results Comparison using PCA\\n1) Subplot Interpretations: Each subplot in Figure 7 reveals\\ndistinct clustering characteristics:\\nK-Means (k=3, Silhouette = 0.581):K-Means produced\\nthree clusters with clear separation but some overlap at the\\nboundaries. The moderate silhouette score reflects reasonable\\nclustering quality, though results may be less robust compared\\nto hierarchical methods.\\nHierarchical – Single Linkage (Silhouette = 0.945:\\nThis method achieved the highest silhouette score, indicating\\nvery strong separation. However, the dendrogram suggests\\n“chained” structures, with most points falling into one large\\ncluster. While statistically strong, this may reduce practical\\nusefulness in business segmentation.\\nHierarchical – Average Linkage (Silhouette = 0.945): Av-\\nerage linkage also scored very highly, forming well-balanced\\nclusters with clear separation. Compared to single linkage, it\\navoids collapsing the dataset into a dominant cluster, mak-\\ning the results more interpretable. Hierarchical – Complete\\nLinkage (Silhouette = 0.909): Complete linkage provided\\na good compromise, producing balanced clusters with solid\\nseparation. The silhouette score is slightly lower than average\\nlinkage but still indicates high-quality clustering\\nDBSCAN (eps=0.181, min samples=10, Silhouette =\\n0.470): DBSCAN detected dense clusters and successfully\\nidentified noise points. Although its silhouette score is\\nlower than hierarchical clustering and K-Means, the method’s\\nstrength lies in capturing outliers, which can reveal unusual\\ncustomer behaviors.\\nOriginal Data (No Clustering): The PCA projection of the\\nraw data shows no clear grouping, underscoring the value of\\nclustering methods in uncovering hidden structures within the\\ndataset.\\nIII. RESULTS AND EVALUATION\\nA. Performance Metrics\\nTable I presents the performance comparison of the clus-\\ntering algorithms. Among them, hierarchical clustering with\\nsingle linkage obtained the best result, achieving a silhouette\\nscore of 0.945, which reflects strong cluster separation and\\ncohesion. In contrast, DBSCAN produced a silhouette score\\nof 0.470, while K-means achieved 0.581.\\nTABLE I\\nCLUSTERING ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE\\nAlgorithm\\nSilhouette\\nIntra-cluster\\nInter-cluster\\nScore\\nDistance\\nDistance\\nK-means\\n0.581\\n0.916\\n2.568\\nHierarchical\\n0.945\\n1.500\\n28.253\\nDBSCAN\\n0.470\\n1.247\\n2.468\\nDBSCAN identified 6.17% of points as noise.

It is efficient and easy to interpret, making it suit-\\nable for business applications. However, it assumes spherical\\nclusters and performed less effectively on irregular patterns in\\nthis dataset.\\nHierarchical\\nclustering\\n(single\\nand\\naverage\\nlinkage)\\nachieved the highest silhouette scores (0.945), showing strong\\nseparation and cohesion. Its main limitation is computational\\ncost for very large datasets and sensitivity to noise.\\nDBSCAN\\nhandled\\nnoise\\npoints\\neffectively\\nbut\\npro-\\nduced\\nthe\\nlowest\\nsilhouette\\nscore\\n(0.470).\\nIts\\nuseful-\\nness lies in detecting outliers, but parameter tuning (eps,\\nminsamples)significantlyaffectsresults.\\nB. Interpretability and Business Relevance\\nK-Means clusters are straightforward to interpret and thus\\nof potential value for application in customer segmentation\\nwithin marketing campaigns. Hierarchical clustering provides\\nan easy-to-understand hierarchical structure with dendrograms,\\nwhich could reveal subgroup relationships. DBSCAN outlier\\ndetection provides insight into unexplained customer behavior,\\nbut the resultant clusters were less of value for business\\napplication in this data set.'),\n",

Feature Scaling\\nFeature scaling was critical for this study because RFM\\nfeatures (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) are measured on very\\ndifferent scales. Monetary values can be in thousands, while\\nfrequency ranges from a few purchases, and recency spans\\nhundreds of days. Without scaling, monetary values would\\ndominate distance calculations. Standardization ensured that\\neach feature contributed equally to the clustering process..\\nD. Stability and Sensitivity\\nK-Means results vary depending on initialization, which\\ncan affect stability. Hierarchical clustering is deterministic but\\nhighly sensitive to the choice of linkage method. DBSCAN’s\\nsensitivity to parameter selection made results unstable across\\ndifferent eps values.\\nE. Distance Metrics\\nThe choice of distance metric strongly influences cluster-\\ning. Euclidean distance, used in this study, works well for\\ncontinuous features but is sensitive to outliers. Manhattan\\ndistance could be more robust to extreme purchase values,\\nwhile cosine similarity could capture customers with similar\\npurchase patterns regardless of scale. Mahalanobis distance,\\naccounting for feature correlations, may be valuable given the\\nstrong correlation observed between frequency and monetary\\nfeatures.\\nV. BUSINESS INSIGHTS\\nThe clustering analysis reveals three actionable customer\\nsegments:\\nHigh-Value Customers (Cluster 2) Action: These are the\\nrevenue spine. Retention is key—priority loyalty programs,\\nearly access to new products, and VIP customer support.\\nEncourage advocacy by engaging them as brand ambassadors.\\nActive Customers (Cluster 0) Action: These customers\\nhave engagement but less consistency. They are good prospects\\nfor upselling and cross-selling. Leverage personalized product\\nrecommendations, seasonal offers, and bundles to increase\\nboth frequency and basket size.\\nAt-Risk or Inactive Customers (Cluster 1)Action: These\\ncustomers require reactivation campaigns. Use personalized\\nwin-back promotions, reminders, and limited-period discounts.\\nAnalyze past preferences to mail personalized product sugges-\\ntions that generate interest.\\nThe PCA visualization confirms that RFM features effec-\\ntively capture customer behavior patterns.\\nVI. CONCLUSION\\nThree methods of customer clustering were compared in\\nthis project. Single linkage hierarchical clustering produced\\nthe highest silhouette score (0.945), DBSCAN (0.470) with\\nthe additional benefit of noise detection. K-means performed\\nlower on the silhouette score (0.581), but with clusters that\\nare easy to interpret for business use.\\nRFM features were proved to be effective at modeling cus-\\ntomer behavior, and the segments derived are helpful to make\\nknowledgeable decisions. The future course can be adding\\nmore behavioral features and trying ensemble techniques.'),\n",
